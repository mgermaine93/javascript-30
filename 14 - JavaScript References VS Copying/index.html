    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      let age = 14
      let age2 = age
      console.log(age, age2) // prints off 100, 100
      age = 25
      console.log(age, age2) // prints off 25, 14

      let city = "San Antonio"
      let city2 = "Burma"
      console.log(city, city2) // prints off "San Antonio", "Burma"
      city = "Pittsburgh"
      console.log(city, city2) // prints off "Pittsburgh", "Burma"

    // Let's say we have an array

      const players = ['Ereth', 'Poppy', 'Rye', 'Ragweed'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

      const team = players;
      console.log(team); // prints off ['Ereth', 'Poppy', 'Rye', 'Ragweed']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

      team[2] = 'Edwin';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

      console.log(team); // prints off ['Ereth', 'Poppy', 'Edwin', 'Ragweed']

    // now here is the problem -- we have edited the original array too!

      console.log(players) // prints off ['Ereth', 'Poppy', 'Edwin', 'Ragweed']

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!  This is because "team" is just a reference to the original array, which is "players".  AKA, if you want to update an array, it will always "reference back".

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

      const team2 = players.slice(); // "slice" makes a copy of the original array.

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      console.log()

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[0] = 'Mr. Ocax';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      console.log(team4); // prints off ['Mr. Ocax', 'Poppy', 'Edwin', 'Ragweed'] 
      console.log(players); // prints off ['Ereth', 'Poppy', 'Edwin', 'Ragweed']

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[1] = 'Avi';
      console.log(team5); // prints off ['Ereth', 'Avi', 'Rye', 'Ragweed'];

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
      };

    // and think we make a copy:

      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 143;
      console.log(person); // prints off {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 143}

    // how do we take a copy instead?

      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
      console.log(captain2); // prints off {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 143}
      console.log(person); // prints off {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80}

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      
      const captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.  However, it is very rare where you would need to clone more than one level deep.

      const avi = {
        name: 'avi',
        age: 60,
        occupation: 'author',
        book: 'Poppy and Rye'
      }

      console.log(avi); // prints off the above

      const author = Object.assign({}, avi); // makes a copy of "avi"

      const author2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(avi)); // the "poor man's" deep clone
